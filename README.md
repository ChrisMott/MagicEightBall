# MagicEightBall
A simple Magic Eight Ball Program

This program is meant to act as a Magic Eight Ball would. 

The user can ask questions with the base responses that a Magic Eight Ball typically has.

The user also has the option to create their own Magic Eight Ball with their own created responses and then use that with themselves or friends.
